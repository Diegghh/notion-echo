Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm your personal bridge to Notion, designed to make noting down your thoughts, tasks, and ideas as easy as sending a message to a friend. Let's get your productivity supercharged without ever leaving Telegram!

Hereâ€™s how to get started:

- `/register` - Securely link me with your Notion account to begin. I'll guide you through this simple process.
- `/defaultpage page_name` - Set up a default Notion page where I'll neatly organize your notes.
- `/note your_note` - Ready to note something down? Just send me a message starting with /note followed by what you'd like to remember. It's as simple as texting!

Need a bit more guidance? Type /help anytime to see what I can do for you.

Remember, your privacy is paramount. I don't keep any of your data. Everything goes straight into your Notion, and nowhere else.
